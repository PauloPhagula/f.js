/**
 * Flux Store Implementation
 * -------------------------
 *
 * Their role is somewhat similar to a model in a traditional MVC,
 * but they manage the state of many objects â€” they are not instances of one object(not a model).
 * Nor are they the same as Backbone's collections.
 * More than simply managing a collection of ORM-style * * objects,
 * stores manage the application state for a particular domain within the application.
 *
 * - Data and application for a logical domain
 * - Setup: Register with the dispatcher
 * - Dispatcher calls registered callback
 * - Emits a change event
 * - Public interface: getters, no setters
 *
 * - Setters are forbidden here
 * - Application state is maintained only in the stores
 * - Stores contain the application state and logic.
 *
 * DOES / IS / HAS
 * - is where the Shell and all of our feature modules access data and business logic in our SPA.
 * - any data or logic, that we want to share between feature modules, or is central to the application.
 * - breakeable into more manageable parts.
 *
 * DOESN'T / ISN'T
 * - require a browser.
 * - provide general purpose utilities
 * - communicate directly with the server
